## Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

I am a Master's student in Bioinformatics, and I use this GitHub to showcase my projects and courseworks.  
While I have several repositories related to my coursework projects (Numerical Analysis and Machine Learning), they are private to respect academic integrity and confidentiality.  

If you'd like to be interested in my work, feel free to reach out!
