## Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
I am a Master's student in Bioinformatics, and I use this GitHub to showcase my projects and experiments.  
While I have several repositories related to my coursework and academic projects, they are private to respect academic integrity and confidentiality.  

If you'd like to discuss my work or collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out!
